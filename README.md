# About Scrabble
Scrabble is a word game that is typically played by 2 to 4 players. The game consists of a game board with a grid of squares and a set of letter tiles. Each player takes turns forming words on the board by placing their letter tiles horizontally or vertically, making sure that the words created are valid in the dictionary.

Here's how Scrabble works and how the game is played:

    Setup: Players choose their letter tiles from a common pool of 100 tiles. The number of tiles and their values are determined by the language version of the game being played. A player typically starts with 7 tiles.

    The Game Board: The game board consists of a grid with various types of squares. Some squares are normal, while others offer bonuses for words or letters placed on them.

    Turn Sequence: Players take turns, and on their turn, they can do the following:
        Form a word on the board by placing tiles.
        Add tiles to existing words to create new words.
        Exchange tiles from their rack with tiles from the pool (but skip their turn).
        Pass their turn.

    Scoring: Each letter tile has a point value, and the score for a word is calculated based on the sum of the point values of the letters used. Some squares on the board can double or triple the score of a letter or the entire word.

    Dictionary: Words played in Scrabble must be valid words found in a Rae dictionary.

    Winning: The game continues until all tiles have been used, and one player uses all of their tiles, or a set number of turns have passed. The player with the highest score at the end wins.

    Strategy: Scrabble involves strategic thinking, as players aim to maximize their points by creating high-scoring words, using premium squares effectively, and blocking opponents.

Scrabble is a game that combines vocabulary, strategy, and a bit of luck due to the random drawing of letter tiles. It's a popular and challenging word game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
